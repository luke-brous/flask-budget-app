# Flask Budget App

A simple Flask web app to manage budgets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luke-brous/flask-budget-app.git
   cd flask-budget-app

2. MAKE SURE YOU RUN THIS COMMAND BEFORE DOING ANY WORK
```bash
    git pull origin main

```
ensures that we both stay in sync and don't work over top of each other. That command will grab the latest code from github and merges it with your local copy.
